											<h3>Chapter 1: Back to the Roots</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The reduction of Nitrogen (N) emission in the Netherlands has been one of the major challenges for a sustainable future and since 2019 an integrated approach was developed to tackle this problem. Nitrogen is one of the key nutrient for plants, however the excess of this nutrient in the soil has proven to threaten the biodiversity in nature areas. Besides Nitrogen as key nutrient, plants also need Phosphorus (P) to sustain important biological processes needed for plant survival. Although the current Nitrogen approach is important, Phosphorus should not be overlooked. It is the ratio between these two nutrients, also called N:P ratio, to have shown to largely shape and form plant communities.
                                        </p>
										<p>Using an extensive European database, research showed that threatened plant species were most common when phosphorus was limited. The reason for this was unclear and new research has provided a possible explanation for this. These plant species are adapted to phosphorus limited environments by investing little in sexual reproduction such as seeds. A sudden increase in phosphorus in the soil makes it difficult for this species to successfully compete with other species.</p>
										<p>This explanation focusses on the aboveground adaptation of plant species on these different nutrient ratios; however the adaptation of plants species belowground remains unclear. Plant species have different strategies to compete belowground for the available nutrients using their roots. They can either invest in fast root developments with a short lifespan or slow root development which are more long-lasting. Furthermore, plants species can decide to either work alone or invest in a collaboration with fungi underground. Till present day, these different strategies have not been assessed from a nutrient ratio perspective, neither has it been used to better understand the threatened status of species.</p>

											<h3>Chapter 2: Naturalized species and their nutrient limitation</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Why certain alien plant species were able to naturalize and become invasive in new environments, while others do not, is one of the central question in invasion ecology. Few studies have been examining the effect of nutrient limitation on non-native species. we are comparing herbaceous naturalized and invasive species to non-naturalized and threatened species on their (1) characteristics (2) strategy and relate this to (3) their preferred nutrient limitation.</p>

										<h3>Chapter 3: Scaling law in plant communities</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Previous studies have identified a scaling law between leaf nitrogen and phosphorus in plants leaf tissue. We are testing if plant communities biomass also abide to such scaling law by using a large database with herbaceous plant community biomass and corresponding community nitrogen phosphorus and potassium content. We are testing if this scaling law is dependent on productivity, potassium, species richness and other environmental variables (water table, soil variables, management form).</p>
