									<h1>About</h1>
								</header>
		<p>I grew up in Maryland, in the USA. I still regularly visit my family there. In 2005, I proudly graduated from Frostburg State University, part of the University Maryland System, with a double major in Geography and International Politics. I studied Cartography with Dr. Fritz Kessler and Political Geography with Dr. George White.
	During one summer I was an intern for MapQuest in Lancaster, PA. 
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			After graduation, I worked for a federal contractor in the Washington, DC metro area where I was a 
			
			
			Hazard Mapping Analyst. My job was to digitize Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood plain maps. In the fall of 2005, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, I was sent to the Louisiana coast to collect raw data. I collected and georeferenced high water marks along with the US Coastguard, to build better flood surge models. It was during that time period that I grew interested in incorporating qualitative data with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). While collecting data, people in the region had such rich stories, values, and experiences to share related to the disaster they just experience, but these data were not going into the GIS. I have devoted my research to these types of issues ever since. Seeking ways to incorporate new and unique voices and values into maps. 
<br>
			<br>
			
In 2009 I completed by MS degree in Geography at McGill University in Montreal where I studied ways in which participation in the map-making process works and doesn't work using online maps with people from the Small Island State of Barbados. My supervisor was Dr. Renee Sieber. In Montreal, I was an intern for the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, where I merged data from Mexico, the United States, and Canada to better understand environmental relationships across the continental scale. These data were early examples of open data as they were made publicly available on their website. 
			<br><br> 
			I went to Vancouver to pursue a Ph.D. at Simon Fraser University where I graduated in 2014. During my Ph.D. research, I investigated the use of mobile computers for improved Injury Surveillance systems. Dr. Nadine Schuurman was my Ph.D. supervisor. During that time, I learned how to make mobile applications and a lot of JavaScript, taught an Introduction to Remote Sensing course, and developed a new Web Cartography course, I worked in a criminology lab, and really learned to write.
<br><br>
In 2014, I started the position of Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Tacoma. There I co-founded and built half of all the courses for the Masters in Geospatial Technologies. From 2018-2019 I worked closely with Professor Menno Jan Kraak at the University of Twente where together we wrote a book about Mapping the Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations. This leads me to where I am today, at the University of Utrecht, in the Netherlands.
